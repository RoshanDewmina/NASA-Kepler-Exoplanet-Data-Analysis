### **NASA Kepler Exoplanet Data Analysis for Space Apps Hackathon**

**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on analyzing Kepler satellite data related to exoplanets, using Excel and Power BI for data cleaning and visualization. The analysis highlights various planetary characteristics such as orbital periods, radii, and eccentricity. The project was part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge, and the insights generated played a crucial role in the team's success.

**Tools Used:**
- Excel for data preparation and cleaning
- Power Query for transforming the data
- Power BI for data visualization and analysis

**Key Features:**
- Data Cleaning: Cleaned and transformed raw Kepler exoplanet data using Excel and Power Query.
- Visualization of Exoplanet Metrics: Built Power BI dashboards displaying orbital periods, planet radii, and eccentricity, enabling deep analysis of planetary data.
- Planetary Patterns: Identified patterns and relationships between stellar and planetary characteristics through interactive visualizations.
- Space Apps Challenge Success: Contributed to the NASA Space Apps Challenge with data-driven visual insights that helped the team make informed decisions.

**How to Run the Project:**
1. Download the Kepler exoplanet dataset from the repository.
2. Open the Excel file for the cleaned data and preparation steps.
3. Load the Power BI file to explore the dashboards and visualize planetary metrics.
